  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be fully implemented. REQ-1 is addressed by adding parseBatteryData/parseChargingStatus to bleNus.ts and wiring batteryPercentage/isCharging state into BluetoothContext and useEyeRBluetooth. REQ-2 is addressed by creating BatteryIndicator.tsx with numeric display, progress bar, battery icon, charging badge, and placeholder state, then integrating it into Dashboard.tsx. No missing requirements or hallucinated features were identified.",
