  "summary": "The diff modifies BluetoothContext.tsx and useEyeRBluetooth.ts, which are the correct files for REQ-1. However, the diff content is truncated and does not explicitly show the navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice() call with { acceptAllDevices: true, optionalServices: ['6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e'] }. The file summaries in frontend-file-summaries.txt and the architectural notes in project_state.json reference 'acceptAllDevices: true' and the NUS UUID, suggesting the change was implemented. Given the truncation, the evidence is indirect but consistent with the requirement being fulfilled.",
