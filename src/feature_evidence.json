      "featureTitle": "Update the Web Bluetooth `navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice` options used for Eye-R so the scan/filter targets the Heart Rate service (0x180d) rather than a UART-based device name (e.g., \"UART Service\") and Nordic UART optionalServices (\"6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e\"). Ensure the filter includes service 0x180d so the Eye-R device can be discovered when it advertises Heart Rate, and keep the rest of the connection flow working with GATT notifications on service 0x180d.",
