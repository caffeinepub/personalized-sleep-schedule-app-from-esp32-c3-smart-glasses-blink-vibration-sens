  "summary": "The diff largely moves the runtime path toward local-first by introducing a localStorage-backed blink history hook and wiring it into Bluetooth ingestion, while deprecating actor bootstrap/flush hooks. However, the schedule generation flow shown does not read from the persisted localStorage blink history as required, and some non-requested UI/pages (API docs/ingestion) appear to have been added/expanded.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Fix 'Generate Schedule' so it reads the needed blink history data from the localStorage-backed blink history (not from any backend/actor source) and completes instantly without storage-related errors.",
      "reason": "In the provided Dashboard implementation, schedule generation uses only the current rolling average/live state and does not reference the persisted localStorage-backed history (`persistedHistory`). This does not satisfy the requirement that schedule generation reads needed blink history data from the localStorage-backed blink history.",

      "description": "Added/expanded an API documentation route/page ('API Docs' navigation and DeviceDataIngestion page) unrelated to the local-first storage/backend-disconnect requirements.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on disabling backend connectivity, removing storage popups, and implementing localStorage persistence and schedule generation changes; it does not request new API documentation pages/routes.",
