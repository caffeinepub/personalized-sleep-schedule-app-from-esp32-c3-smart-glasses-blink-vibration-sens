  "summary": "The diff adds a new frontend Smoke Test page/route and makes substantial backend data model/storage changes (e.g., BlinkSummary and maps), but it does not implement any mechanism to force a clean rebuild/redeploy to the live canister or to capture verbatim build/deploy error output as required.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Force a clean rebuild of the Eye-R project (frontend + backend) and redeploy the resulting build artifacts to the live canister (not draft).",
      "reason": "No changes in the diff indicate build pipeline/scripts/commands for clean rebuild, cache clearing, or deployment to the live canister; the modifications are application code changes only.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx",

      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "If the rebuild or redeploy fails, capture and present the exact build/deploy error output (verbatim) including the failing command, exit code, and the full compiler/toolchain error text.",
      "reason": "The diff does not add any logging/reporting for build or deploy failures (no CI scripts, deploy scripts, or command wrappers capturing stdout/stderr and exit codes). The added 'Smoke Test' page is a runtime connectivity check, not build/deploy error capture.",

        "frontend/src/pages/SmokeTest.tsx",
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"

    {
      "description": "Added a new 'Smoke Test' page and route (/smoke-test) with UI to verify frontend-backend communication and display test status.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest asks for forced clean rebuild/redeploy and verbatim build/deploy error reporting, not adding new UI pages/routes for runtime smoke testing.",

    {
      "description": "Backend introduces a new BlinkSummary type and corresponding storage (blinkSummariesMap) plus related structural changes in backend/main.mo.",
      "reason": "These backend data model changes are unrelated to forcing a clean rebuild/redeploy or capturing deploy errors, and appear to be new/expanded functionality beyond the deployment-unblocking scope.",
