  "summary": "REQ-14 appears implemented: the Eye-R Web Bluetooth requestDevice call is updated to filter by the Heart Rate service (0x180d) and no longer relies on a UART-based name/optionalServices UUID, while continuing to use Heart Rate service/characteristic for notifications.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added fallback logic to discover “any notifying characteristic” if the standard Heart Rate Measurement characteristic (0x2a37) is not found.",
      "reason": "REQ-14 only asks to adjust requestDevice filtering away from UART and keep the existing Heart Rate (0x180d) notification flow working; it does not request expanding characteristic discovery behavior.",
