  "summary": "REQ-1 appears partially implemented (new calibrated thresholds and eye-state classification added), but the diff is truncated before showing the actual blink-counting transition logic, so full compliance with the transition/guard acceptance criteria can’t be confirmed from the provided evidence. REQ-2 can’t be confirmed because the relevant copy changes in DeviceConnection.tsx are truncated. Additional unrelated files (project_state.json, frontend-file-summaries.txt) were modified without being requested.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "A blink is counted when the sensor reading transitions from the open state into the closed state, with a guard preventing multiple counts during a single closure; staying in open counts none; staying in closed counts at most one until returning to open.",
      "reason": "BluetoothContext.tsx shows new thresholds and an eye-state classifier, but the diff is truncated before the code that increments blink count / records timestamps, so the required open→closed transition counting and guard behavior is not verifiable from the provided diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Update the \"Raw Sensor Reading (Debug)\" description and Help section note in DeviceConnection.tsx to remove references to \"drops below 30\" and describe the calibrated open/closed light-level thresholds in English, without unrelated UI text changes.",
      "reason": "DeviceConnection.tsx is truncated before the debug/help copy sections, so it’s not possible to confirm the specific text was updated and that no unrelated UI text was changed.",
